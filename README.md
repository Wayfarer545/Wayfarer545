### Hello there!  
I’m a Python developer with over three years of experience, focused on backend web development. 
I work with FastAPI, SQLModel (Postgres, SQLite), and Redis. I’m passionate about microservices, connecting them via gRPC and HTTP, and strive to practice Clean Architecture. 
Currently, I’m diving deep into Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Skilled in GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Docker Compose, I enjoy deploying services on Linux servers. 

Here on GitHub, you’ll find samples of my work—my main projects live on my personal GitLab server. 
Always excited about clean code, optimization, and new tech challenges!
